# Edge-Detection-using-Canny-and-Sobel-Operators-A-Digital-Image-Processing-Project.
Edge Detection â€“ Canny &amp; Sobel (Digital Image Processing)  This project demonstrates edge detection techniques using the Canny and Sobel operators, implemented in Python (OpenCV) within Google Colab. It processes both single images and datasets, visualizing the detected edges and comparing both algorithms side by side.

This project demonstrates **edge detection** techniques using the **Canny** and **Sobel** operators in **Python (OpenCV)**.  
Developed and tested in **Google Colab**, it processes both single images and datasets, compares both methods visually, and saves results automatically to Google Drive.
